## Welcome to Effect-TS - Jest

Please follow up to: [https://github.com/Effect-TS/jest/tree/master/packages/jest](https://github.com/Effect-TS/jest/tree/master/packages/jest)

## Install

We recommend the usage of `yarn` and if you have multiple packages the usage of `yarn workspaces` that handles by default hoisting of dependencies:

```sh
yarn add @effect-ts/system @effect-ts/tracing-utils @effect-ts/core @effect-ts/jest
```
